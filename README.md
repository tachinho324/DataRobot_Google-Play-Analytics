# I. ​Project Overview 
- Objective: Predict app ratings to optimize features, enhance user satisfaction, and drive app success.
- Business Problem: Identify key factors influencing ratings to help developers and businesses improve app performance.
- Target Variable: Rating—impacted by Reviews, Installs, and Rating Categories.
- Data Choice: Cleaned dataset with derived features (e.g., Log_Installs, Log_Reviews) for improved accuracy.

# II. Data Transformation
## Key Steps:
- Removed missing/invalid values, standardized formats, and engineered features (e.g., Price_Installs, days_since_update).
- Categorized Ratings (Low/Medium/High) for better interpretability.
- Scaled numeric features (e.g., z-scores) to enhance model performance.

# III. Data Exploration
## Findings:
- High ratings (4-5) dominate, with Installs and Reviews positively influencing ratings.
- Free apps generally receive better ratings than paid apps.
- Frequent updates correlate with higher ratings.
